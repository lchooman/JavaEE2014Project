                    <h1>Unlimited Entertainment Ltd</h1>
                    <p>Unlimited Entertainment Ltd was incorporated in December 2008, in California.</p>
                    <p>After a few years of operation, Unlimited Entertainment Ltd finally launched its web site in November 2014 to cater
                        for the best experience of its increasingly cyber-oriented movie-goers.</p>
                    <p>Unlimited Entertainment Ltd currently manages <h:outputText value="#{aboutUsBean.numTheaters}" /> movie theaters, as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <ui:repeat value="#{aboutUsBean.theaters}" var="theater" >
                            <li><h:outputText value="#{theater.name}" /> - with <h:outputText value="#{theater.numberOfHalls}" />
                                halls totaling <h:outputText value="#{theater.totalHallSeats}" /> seats.</li>
                        </ui:repeat>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                    <p>Our mission statement is to supply our movie-goers with the most accurate information before they set out their journeys for their preferred movie theaters.</p>
                    <p>In our movie theaters, we strive to provide our movie-goers the best possible experience.</p>
                    <h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>Our vision for the next five years is to double the current number of movie theaters under our management to reach out to a bigger part of California.</p>
